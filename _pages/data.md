## Datasets

### A Benchmark Dataset of Chinese Development Finance with Climate Relevance and SDG Annotations (2000–2021)

This dataset provides a systematically constructed and validated record of Chinese development finance projects with climate relevance, covering the period from 2000 to 2021. It combines project-level information with detailed annotations on climate relevance and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) alignment, aiming to improve transparency and comparability in empirical research on international climate finance.

The dataset is based on a hybrid approach that integrates manual expert annotation with cross-verification procedures, ensuring consistency and reliability across thematic classifications.
