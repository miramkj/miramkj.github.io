### [A Benchmark Dataset of Chinese Development Finance with Climate Relevance and SDG Annotations(2000–2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06605-9)

This dataset presents a comprehensive, project-level benchmark of Chinese development finance with explicit climate relevance and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) annotations, covering the period from 2000 to 2021. It is designed to support empirical research on international climate finance, development assistance, and energy transition by improving transparency, comparability, and reproducibility across studies.

The dataset integrates detailed project metadata with systematically coded indicators of climate relevance and SDG alignment. Its construction follows a hybrid methodology that combines expert manual annotation with structured cross-validation procedures, ensuring internal consistency and robustness across thematic classifications.

The dataset has been peer-reviewed and published in *Scientific Data*.

The full dataset, documentation, and coding framework are available through the journal publication and its associated repositories. These materials provide detailed descriptions of data sources, annotation rules, validation procedures, and recommended use cases for empirical analysis.
