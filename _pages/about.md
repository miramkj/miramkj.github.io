I am a third-year PhD candidate at the Institute for Global Public Policy, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Haoqi Qian. I am currently a visiting doctoral researcher at Heidelberg University, where I will remain until September 2026. I hold a dual master’s degree in Global Political Economy from Fudan University and the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a Bachelor of Arts from the Honors College of Shanghai International Studies University.

My research lies at the intersection of international political economy, climate finance, and global development. I study how international climate and development finance shapes socioeconomic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and emerging donors such as China. My work addresses three core questions: how different providers allocate climate and development finance across countries and sectors; how these financial flows affect inequality within recipient countries; and how institutional capacity and governance conditions mediate policy effectiveness under climate and development constraints.

Methodologically, I work with a mixed empirical toolkit that combines applied econometrics, geocoded project-level data, and macro-structural modeling. My empirical analyses integrate household-level surveys with geocoded development finance data using spatial and panel methods to study distributional and institutional heterogeneity. In parallel, I employ computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to examine economy-wide and sectoral responses to climate finance and policy shocks. My research is implemented primarily in Python, R, Stata, and GAMS, with an emphasis on reproducibility and transparency.
