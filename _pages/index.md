Welcome! I am Ji (Mira) Qi, a third-year PhD candidate at the Institute for Global Public Policy, **Fudan University**, supervised by [Prof. Haoqi Qian](https://www.hawkinqian.com/). I am a visiting doctoral researcher at Heidelberg University from October 2025 to September 2026. I hold a dual master’s degree in Global Political Economy from **Fudan University** and **the London School of Economics and Political Science**, and a Bachelor of Arts from **Shanghai International Studies University**.

My research lies at the intersection of **international political economy**, **climate finance**, and **global development**. I study how international climate and development finance shapes socioeconomic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and emerging donors such as China. I work on three main research areas:
(1) international climate and development finance;
(2) China’s role in global climate governance;
(3) inequality and institutions in the Global South.

Methodologically, I combine econometric analysis and computational workflows. I mainly work with Stata, Python, and R, and also use QGIS for spatial analysis and GAMS for computable general equilibrium modeling.
