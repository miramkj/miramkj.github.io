Welcome! I am a third-year PhD candidate at the Institute for Global Public Policy, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Haoqi Qian. I am currently a visiting doctoral researcher at Heidelberg University, where I will remain until September 2026. I hold a dual master’s degree in Global Political Economy from Fudan University and the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a Bachelor of Arts from the Honors College of Shanghai International Studies University.

My research lies at the intersection of international political economy, climate finance, and global development. I study how international climate and development finance shapes socioeconomic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and emerging donors such as China. My work addresses three core questions: how different providers allocate climate and development finance across countries and sectors; how these financial flows affect inequality within recipient countries; and how institutional capacity and governance conditions mediate policy effectiveness under climate and development constraints.

Methodologically, I combine econometric analysis and computational workflows. I mainly work with Stata, Python, and R, and also use QGIS for spatial analysis and GAMS for computable general equilibrium modeling.
