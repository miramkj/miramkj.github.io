Welcome! **I am Ji (Mira) Qi**, a third-year PhD candidate at the [Institute for Global Public Policy](https://igpp.fudan.edu.cn/igppen/main.htm), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Haoqi Qian](https://www.hawkinqian.com/). From October 2025 to September 2026, I am a visiting doctoral researcher at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) at the Chair of International and Development Politics under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Axel Dreher](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/de/professuren/internationale-wirtschafts-und-entwicklungspolitik). I hold a dual master’s degree in Global Political Economy from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and [the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), and a Bachelor of Arts from [Shanghai International Studies University](https://en.shisu.edu.cn/).

My research lies at the intersection of **international political economy**, **climate finance**, and **global development**. I study how international climate and development finance shapes socioeconomic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and emerging donors such as China. I work on three main research areas:
(1) international climate and development finance;
(2) China’s role in global climate governance;
(3) inequality and institutions in the Global South.
